# College python project

In this repository, you will find my first college python assignment.

I have decided to make it public because it is simple but could still be able to help.

>  1. Firstly, this program retrieves the data from Studentmarks.txt
> 2. After this it goes and sorts through it, putting the data into 3 arrays.
> 3. With these arrays it will then find the biggest number in the examMarks array and match it with the person who got the mark.
> 4. It displayed this information in the terminal.
> 5. After this it will create a new file called NewFileResults.txt and write the data from the 3 arrays into it.
